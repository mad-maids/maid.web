As a designer and tech lover in general I want create a post detailing what I use on the daily. Whether it be for coding, designing, or general daily tasks. One thing to mention is that I am going to be breaking this blog post into 3 main sections which includes my personal rig, along with what I use when I am in the mood for coding or even designing.

## The Rig

First off my system is not really that interesting. Either way it is still a beefy piece of machinery. One fun fact about my system is that almost purchased a prebuilt from Origin PC but for some reason they could not verify my address. So I ended up building it myself and it was not that difficult to do.

Here is the <b>current part list</b>.
