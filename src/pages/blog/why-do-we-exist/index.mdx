Once upon a time, there were a developer who loved to code. "He" met lots of good guys who share their helping hand and they studied their first two years at Westminster International University in Tashkent. As the time flew, he managed to create lots
of solution for many problems. As an example, he created Westmaid who helped a number of students to manage and get to know more about their schedule and modules. Once, that dev guy felt like he was missing something precious. He found out that all
time he was coding alone on solo. So, he decided to team up with someone who has lots of skills to share with him and others. Lucky to him, he was friend of an awesome organization namely 70+ and he decided to use this as an opportunity to create a
perfect dev capsule for seniors. After a while, he created yet another organization "Mad Maids" under the 70+.

However, this does not mean we can just create a website, deploy it, and then neglect it for a few years being left to wonder why no leads are coming in through the site. We conjured up some useful warnings signs when it is time to update the website.

## Coding and team dev style

Actually, we decided to go with DevOps. The reason why we picked up this style is that we love to do something and practice a lot altogether. In order to keep contributing, we have to cycle over the process over and over, so that's why we preferred DevOps
alongside GitHub Organization & Plan.

## Junior & Middle Devs?

We thought hat it's useful to get some juniors and middles into our team, so they can get some experience either it will be a good practise for seniors to work with juniors.
