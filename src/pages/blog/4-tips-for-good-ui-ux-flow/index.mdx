## Make the Navigation Easy to Use

Navigation is the most important, highly utilized element of any website. It is the main way users get around while browsing your site so why not treat it with a little respect? One thing you can do is give it a sense of intuitiveness, making it simple to use. There is nothing worse than having a cluttered navigation menu that makes it challenging for your visitors to browse your website. For a rule of thumb, the user should be able to access any information with only 3 clicks or less, starting from the homepage.

## Create an Intuitive Sitemap

Sitemaps, or the page structure of a website, is the roadmap to every website design. The important thing about sitemaps is that it forces the designer to strip away the design mindset and fully focus on the content. Making the user flow of content intuitive and fluid makes it easier when building the site while giving the visitor less of a headache browsing the site. Never skip steps in the planning stages of the website because ultimately an efficient foundation equals greater end-user satisfaction.

## Clean use of Typefaces

Typography is paramount in the overall process of building a website. Font choice is just as important of a design element as illustrations or textures. However, avoid the temptation of overusing fonts. Use a maximum of three typefaces with different weights giving structure and cohesion to the siteâ€™s overall look and feel.

## Interactive Design

Another way to give your site some substantial visual prowess is through user interactions. Nowadays it would not hurt to give a little pizazz to the website by adding a clever animation here and there. Quite honestly it is not an important aspect to add to your website but it could undoubtably help make for a more fun and memorable user experience.
