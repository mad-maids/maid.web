Websites are so crucial in today’s growing technological age. Quite honestly, it is strange to think that before the internet people had to search through their local print Yellow Pages to find companies, whereas today most everything is shifting over to digital.

However, this does not mean we can just create a website, deploy it, and then neglect it for a few years being left to wonder why no leads are coming in through the site. We conjured up some useful warnings signs when it is time to update the website.

## Looks and Feels Outdated

The look and feel of your website are as important as the content you add to it. Today’s web standards are changing faster and faster than ever. Keeping up with some of the top design trends not only tells your customers that you care; it tells them that your brand is cutting edge.

You owe it to yourself to reflect your brand message in the design of your site, updating the content every few years to enhance the usability and clarity. This helps keep your website looking fresh in the eyes of your visitors.

## Has a Poor User Experience

Having poor user experience within your site not only indicates you need a whole site overhaul but also prevents visitors from returning to your website. Sites with difficult navigations can make it hard for the viewer to understand the use of your website, more importantly the content or service that you are offering them. Taking in consideration on how the navigates your website is key to getting them to return to your back.

## Website Traffic is Plummeting

The whole reason why you have a website is to connect with your patrons, the people that keep your business or company running smoothly. Having low traffic not only hurts your potential revenue but the company or business as a whole. So in short keep an eye on the metrics and if traffic continues to diminish, it’s time for a refresh.

## Not Mobile Friendly

One of the things that position your site to be highly ranked in SEO depends on the performance of both mobile and desktop versions of your site. If the mobile version of your site is not working effectively or you down right have not considered mobile-friendliness within your website, it could lower your SEO ranking. So in return, mobile optimization should be a priority when building your site and or updating it.

## Low SEO Ranking or None at All

SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is a series of techniques that determine whether your site can be found on search engines without much effort. In other words, having good SEO gives your website the edge it needs to show up in people’s search engines when searching relevant content. If your website has low SEO rankings then it is most likely that time of the month to sit down, drink some coffee and update your site.
