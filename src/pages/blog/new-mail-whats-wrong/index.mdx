“A wireframe is a schematic, a blueprint, useful to help you and your programmers and designers think and communicate about the structure of the software or website you’re building.” ([Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/learn/resources/articles/what-are-wireframes/))

When creating a user-oriented product like a website or mobile app, sometimes we can get stuck in the trap of dipping straight into the design without understanding the bigger picture of the layout. To which, is the reason wireframes come into play in the design process. Furthermore, it helps sell the overall project layout without focusing on the design.
