## New mail, new servers

![](/assets/blog/1_94CVbnhNY1BpnKNYeLs9_Q.jpeg)

WIUT uses Microsoft Exchange to manage most of their systems and up to the new
update, it was deployed into their server. Recently, all of sudden they decided
to move their system to cloud by deploying to Microsoft's official server which
broke lots of webhook and configs. In this post, we will take a look at those
changes and how to restore your sessions to native mail applications.

## Mail app isn't working anymore?

With servers being changed, addresses to those server had also changed. If you
used `nsurname@students.wiut.uz`, now it is in form of `xxxyyyzz@wiut.uz`. Also,
you have to use Microsoft's OAth to login to your account.
